> EJS Template editor for nodemailer

## About

I didn't find any similar tool so I made it. Feel free to fork it and modify it for your needs.

## Getting Started

```shell
npm install skrafft/nodemailer-template-editor
```

Edit the .env file if you need to change the default directories and create the directories according to your changes.

```shell
node server.js
```
